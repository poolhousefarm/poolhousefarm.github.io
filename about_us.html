<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
    Pool House Farm is a small, family-run riding school and livery
    yard located in Balsall Common.
</p>
<p>
    We are one of the only riding schools in Britain to specialise in teaching Mounted Games
    as well as offering a wide range of other equine activities for all ages.
</p>
<h2>What We Offer</h2>
<p>
    Here at Pool House Farm, we are happy to cater for all abilities
    and ages. No matter if you have been riding for years or are only just
    beginning, you will be delighted by how much you will learn in the cheerful,
    relaxed environment that we provide.
</p>
<p>
    Whether you want to jump, school, dabble in dressage or a mixture all, we have the
    horses and facilities to suite you. As well as this, we have the equipment to teach
    and play a variety of mounted games. Hacking is also available on the quiet roads
    surrounding the farm.

<h2>Own a Pony for a Day</h2>
<p>
    Having a pony of their very own is one of the most exiting ideas
    for many children. We hold pony days during school holidays for any child
    who wants to experience this. Arrive in the morning with a packed lunch
    and spend the whole day with one of our ponies, learning how to care for him or her.
